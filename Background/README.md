# Notes for the analysis

linear regression model for 9 outcomes on obesity and CpG  
  
Although we discussed include the variable “infant sex” as a covariate, we actually did the chemicals-methylation analysis stratified by sex. So the DMRs were only detected among male offspring. Therefore we should probably restrict our analysis to individuals with infant_sex = 2 (males), at least to begin with.  
There will be missing data for some outcomes, I think it is OK if the sample size differs for each model.
